# File Read & Write Challenge + Error Handling Lab

This project is a simple Python program that demonstrates **file handling** and **error handling**.  
It was created as part of a programming lab assignment.

This code includes: 
- Reading a file specified by the user.
- Handling errors if the file does not exist or cannot be read.
- Modifying the file content (example: converts text to **uppercase**).
- Writing the modified content into a new file.
